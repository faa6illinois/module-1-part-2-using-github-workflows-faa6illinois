# Fernanda Alvarado Introduction

Hello Everyone!

I am currently in my second semester of the Gradute Certificate Program for the Weather and Climate Risk & Data Analytics. 

I currently work for Con Edison, a utility in New York City, but live in New Jersey. With this certificate, I hope to advance my career in resource data analytics.

This is the repository for Module 1 Part 2. Here I created a python code that request user input for their birthday and calculates their age in days, which is then returned.

A branch was created with edits to the code and then merged with the main branch.

Thank you!
